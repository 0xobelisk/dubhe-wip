# Monster Hunter

By the end of this tutorial you will learn how to create your own EVM application using Dubhe.
This will help you understand how Dubhe works and how it can be used to build any other MOVE application or onchain game.

We will also be exploring the ECS model, a software architectural pattern used commonly in video game development.

# Learning goals

The MonsterHunter tutorial is a crash course in everything Dubhe but it is a particularly good resource for learning how to build onchain games using ECS. You can expect to learn the following:

- Onchain game development using the [ECS model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system).
- How to create [schemas](https://dubhe-docs.vercel.app/dubhe/sui/schemas), interact with them using Systems, and call them from the client.
- Querying onchain data from the Dubhe Indexer.
- Deploying all of the above to a testnet.

You can expect your finished product to look something like this:
